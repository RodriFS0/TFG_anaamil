This repository is used to Update the database "final_data" used to train the machine learning models in the repository TFG_RodrigoFernandez. To execute this code you will need three datasets:
1- "all_classified" (provided in the repository) wich cointains more than 5 milion clasified molecules.
2- "data" that makes reference to the RepoRT database from @michaelwitting in his repository "RepoRT", escecificly the forder "processed_data". This Database its      countinuosly growing, in this way i strongly advise to check if the database has grown in comparason to the one save localy in this repository.
